    "Ans:  An expression is a combination of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that produce a single value. It represents a computation or a calculation and is evaluated to yield a result. Expressions can be as simple as a single constant value or as complex as a combination of multiple operations and sub-expressions.\n",

    "2).Variables: Named storage locations that hold values during the program's execution. Variables are used to store and manipulate data. \n",
    "For example, x and y could be variables representing numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3).Operators: Symbols or keywords that represent specific operations to be performed on the operands (variables, literals, or sub-expressions).\n",
    "Examples of operators include + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), = (assignment), and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "4).Function calls: Invoking a function to perform specific tasks or computations. Functions can take arguments (inputs) and return a result. The result of a function call can also be part of an expression."
